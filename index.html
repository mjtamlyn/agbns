                <h3>What is the National Series?</h3>
                <article class="intro">
                    <p>The Archery GB National series is the premier domestic archery competition. There are 5 legs through the year, with the top 4 ranked archers in each category progressing to the finals. The competition is open to all, shooting both compound and recurve bows.</p>
                    <p>The 2012 edition has just 4 legs to make way for the olympics, with the overall rankings determined by the best 2 results. Oxford Archers were awarded the first leg in May, comprising a full weekend of shooting, a FITA 720 with head to heads on the Saturday, followed by a full FITA round on the Sunday. The second leg was the Midsummer Tournament, held at the National Sports Centre in Lilleshall, with the shooting following the same format as the first leg. The final two legs were hosted by Clophill Archery Club in Bedfordshire, and take place over one weekend. Both days are a FITA 720 followed by head to heads.</p>
                    <p>The final returns to Oxford, this time in the city centre on Christ Church Meadows. Head to head matches comprising semi finals and finals take place in each category. Taking place over the August bank holiday weekend, between the Olympics and the Paralympics, the finals are sure to be a spectacular occasion.</p>

                    <h3>Oxford <small>12th & 13th May 2012</small></h3>
                    <img src="http://oxford-archers.org/images/stories/body_photos/scoring_longshot.jpg">
                    <p>The first leg of the 2012 National Series took place in Oxford on the 12th and 13th of May. Nearly 200 archers took part over the weekend in dry but breezy conditions. Three of new newly announced Olympic teams were in attendence, along with both of the reserve archers.</p>
                    <p>Soon to be 6 type olympian Alison Williamson was in fine form, winning both the ranking round and the FITA, and finishing second in the Head to Heads to follow olympian Naomi Folkard to take victory in the ladies recurve. Olympic reserve Charlotte Burgess was in third, with Jeanetta Braun in 4th. The men's olympic reserve archer Michael Peart also shone, seeding second and then winning the head to heads, with a 5th place in the FITA round proving enough for victory, ahead of Jon Shales and last year's overall winner Simon Terry. Bob Lowe wrapped up the top four.</p>
                    <p>A strong field was also present in the compound division, including all four of the mens finalists from the 2011. They did not disappoint, with Duncan Busby dominant in all but the final of the head to heads, where a national record of 149 out of 150 from Adam Ravenscroft saw Busby pushed into second place. Ravenscroft, Grimwood and White completed the top four on a successful day for the big names. The ladies was won by Andrea Gales after victory in both the 720 and the FITA. Rikki Bingham took third, and Emma Terry matched her husband with a third place after two second places on the first day. Pauline Burfitt's consistent good performances earned her fourth, ahead of Christie Westman who although winning the elimination, was 8th in the ranking and 7th in the FITA to drop to 5th overall.</p>

                    <p>For the second leg, we moved to the home of Archery GB - the national sports centre at Lilleshall. The regular midsummer shoot took on the same format as the Oxford leg, with a 720 and head to heads followed by a FITA. The difficult conditions continued, with the archers contending with heavy showers on Saturday and windy conditions throughout.</p>
                    <p>In the compound division, Dani Brown was in spectacular form as she dominated all three competitions to wrap up victory. Andrea Gales carried on her good momentum from Oxford with a 3rd in the ranking round followed by two second places to take second. Pauline Burfitt finished in third and Nichola Simpson in fourth. Adam Ravenscroft took the overall title this time, with three of the four big names in the top four again. Phil Glover joined them in third, enjoying a good run of form following medals at the European Championships in Cyprus. Duncan Busby missed out down in 6th after an early exit from the head the heads meaning winning the ranking round and coming second in the FITA was not enough.</p>
                    <p>Larry Godfrey returned from the World Cup in Ogden in imperious form, matching Dani's achievement in winning all three sections for a comfortable victory. The rest of the olympic team rounded out the top three, with Alan Wills pipping Simon Terry to second by virtue of a better performance in the Head to Heads. Behind them the younger generation are flexing their muscles, with Tom Barber in 4th and George Harding enjoying a fantastic run to the final of the Head to Heads to finish 5th. The Danish and British women's teams enjoyed an exciting tussle on the Saturday, with the Danish coming out on top with a 1-2 in the Head to Heads. However the top four seeds and semi finalists did not shoot the Sunday, which left the overall results open to the chasing pack. Olympic reserve Charlotte Burgess took the win, with Jeanetta Braun, Victoria Savage and Estelle Edwick rounding out the top 4.</p>
